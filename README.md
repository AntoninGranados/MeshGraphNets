# Implementation of the MeshGraphNets paper

> Tobias Pfaff, Meire Fortunato, Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, & Peter W. Battaglia. (2021). Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks.

The implementation is focused on *Lagragian systems* (deformable objects such as cloth).

Do *NOT* use this repository as a reference. It is not implemented in an efficient way, and the remeshing algorithm does not work correctly.

### Rollout on the *Flag Simple* dataset
